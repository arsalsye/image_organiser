# Image Organiser

Given an input folder with some images, it will group them into folders by
- Location

For example) 2024/June - Santorini


# TODO

- Detect duplicate images
- Automatically create albums containing good pictures
- Detect pictures where people's eyes are closed
- Add a tagging system so that images can be searched by tags (and auto annotate tags on each image)
